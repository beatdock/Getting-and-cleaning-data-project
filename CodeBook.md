#Raw dataset

##Information
* This dataset was collected with a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity datas were captured. The obtained datas have been randomly partitioned into two sets where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

* See the README.txt file in the "UCI HAR Dataset.zip" for further details.
